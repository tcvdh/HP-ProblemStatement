\section{Approach} \label{sec:approach}

Explain in this section how you anticipate you can answer the question(s) formulated in Section~\ref{sec:researchq}. The goal is to show that the research is feasible. For this reason, this section is mainly methodological; the pragmatic plans on how to complete all this work follow, in Section~\ref{sec:plan}. See, for example, Sections~I (overview) and~V.A (experiment design) of~\cite{DBLP:conf/sc/AndreadisVMI18}.

Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Describe the approach, for each research question. Emphasis on method(s) -- What? Expected contribution.

\item 
Introduce intuition about the key innovation and/or conceptual contribution.

\item 
Try to explain why the approach would work. Explain the expected technical contribution.

\end{enumerate}
