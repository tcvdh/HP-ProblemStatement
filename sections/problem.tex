\section{Problem}
We identified a critical gap in the current simulation tools: \textbf{There is no accessible
instrument to accurately predict the cost-efficiency and energy impact of LLM training
configurations on homogeneous clusters}. While there is a growing body of research that has focused
on Model Optimization, reducing computational complexity by up to 35\% through techniques like
sparse training and quantization\cite{10.5120/ijca2025925323}, far less attention has been given to
System Optimization. Even with highly compressed models, the infrastructure overheads of fault
tolerance and synchronization persist. Current simulators often focus on the former (compute time)
while ignoring the latter (system-level overheads), creating a blind spot in energy estimation.
Specifically, we identify the following issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The Fallacy of Idealized Execution}: Existing simulators typically model training jobs
	      under the assumption of idealized execution, treating homogeneous clusters as perfectly
	      synchronized straggler free systems. This ignores the non-deterministic delays of 3D
	      parallelism. As revealed from production traces, even in homogeneous clusters designed
	      for stability, "software stragglers" (caused by uneven pipeline partitioning or garbage
	      collection pauses) can cause the system to waste up to 45\% of its allocated GPU
	      resources\cite{lin2025stragglers}. Current tools fail to capture these synchronization inefficiencies, leading to
	      overly optimistic performance and energy estimates that mask real-world efficiency
	      losses.
	\item \textbf{Ignored Reliability Costs}:
\end{itemize}
