% Explain in this section how you expect to complete the parts defined in Section~\ref{sec:approach}. The goal is to show the work is feasible in the allocated time.

% Notes:
% Notes:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item 
% Understand this is a preliminary plan.
%
% \item 
% Try to define at least the large components of the project. To do this, discuss with the project supervisor and/or consult a good article published recently in the field. For the running example, consult~\cite{DBLP:conf/sc/AndreadisVMI18}.
%
% \item
% Try to plan tasks with a granularity of at most one week, and ideally with a granularity of a day. Try to make the near-future tasks SMART. Plan tasks long into the future of the project as \textit{slack}. 
%
% \item
% Try to attach milestones and key deliverables to the most important tasks. Make sure deliverables include the final report (or article) and at least one presentation (hopefully, in a major scientific venue).
%
% \item
% Revisit the plans as soon as you complete a task, but especially after the first few tasks of a kind, e.g., a literature review task (you read a new article), a design iteration (you made or improved a design), an implementation task (you coded a new feature), an experiment task (you conducted one experiment).

%
% For the running example, the research plan included:
% \begin{verbatim}
% ```
% I plan to take the first two research questions in one step, since
% they are closely related:
%
% To build a representative abstraction, I need to survey the 
% existing approaches in the field. This way, the validation step 
% is combined with the design step. This combined stage I
% intend to work on in the coming three months, and 
% have a first report on my results ready by late January 2017.
%
% After this stage is completed, I will begin integrating it in the
% OpenDC project [n.b., the simulator].
% Because I can imagine that this step will take a 
% substantial amount of time,  I plan to have produced a first, 
% full prototype of this integration by May 2017.
%
% I will try to keep the paper writing process parallel to 
% these two stages as much as possible. However, knowing that 
% this is difficult, I am allocating the time from June to
% July of 2017 to tie together the pieces and get 
% this paper ready for publication.
