\section{Research Question(s)} \label{sec:researchq}

Explain in this section the core research of the project. The goal is to show that the research is sufficiently balanced and broad. See also Sections~I and the short formulations (e.g., ``we investigate...'') in the following sections of~\cite{DBLP:conf/sc/AndreadisVMI18}. 

Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Formulate the main research question. 

\item 
Define the scope of the project. Typically, the scope of the project is much smaller than the scope of the problem (defined in Section~\ref{sec:problem}).

\item 
Define detailed research questions. For each, explain at least: \textit{Why?}, \textit{Why important?}, and \textit{Why challenging?}

\end{enumerate}
